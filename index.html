                <h2>The Hidden Pen Names</h2>
                <p>There are plenty of writers who write and remain undiscovered. These pen names hide their actual,
                    realistic selves from their writer selves. This book will take you on a journey of emotions. It has
                    all the thoughts & those emotions behind the writers who slipped their words to make them a part of
                    this book. It deals with the agony, sadness, love, joy, and so many more emotions that writers have
                    expressed through their words. There may be so many words and write-ups that you may find close
                    enough to hide yourselves. It may feel just as if it is your life spilled on the papers.
                    Our writers have written these inclusive pieces which we have presented before you to indulge. </p>

                <h2>Some Unsent Words of Life</h2>
                <p>We have always unsaid things for some people in our lives. Some unsaid love stories, some unsaid
                    apologies and so much more. This book is all about such unsaid tales. It narrates the underlying,
                    unexpressed, unsaid emotions of the writers who penned it down. It will be all about what the
                    writers and the readers feel through the (unsaid) words. Sometimes, we feel a lot but express very
                    less. This book expresses all that.</p>
